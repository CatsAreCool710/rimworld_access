COLONIST ACTIONS
----------------
]             Open order menu (includes draft mode orders like Move, Attack)
R             Toggle draft mode for selected colonist
Alt+M         Display mood information and thoughts

S             Open schedule menu (manage colonist timetables)
Shift+A       Open assign menu (manage outfits, food, drugs, areas, reading)


WORK MENU (Press Alt+W)
-----------------------
Manage colonist work assignments with support for both simple mode and manual priorities.

Common Controls:
Up/Down       Navigate work types (stops at top/bottom)
Tab           Switch to next colonist
Shift+Tab     Switch to previous colonist
M             Toggle between simple mode and manual priorities mode
Enter         Save all changes and close
Escape        Cancel changes and close

Simple Mode (toggle work types on/off):
Space         Toggle selected work type enabled/disabled

Manual Priority Mode (assign priority numbers 1-4):
0-4           Set priority directly (0=disabled, 1=highest, 4=lowest)
Space         Quick toggle between disabled and default (priority 3)
Shift+Up      Move work type up in priority order (affects execution when priorities equal)
Shift+Down    Move work type down in priority order (affects execution when priorities equal)

Notes:
- In manual priority mode, lower numbers execute first (1 before 2 before 3 before 4)
- Work types with the same priority number use list order as tiebreaker
- Changes are marked as "(pending)" until you press Enter to save
- Column reordering (Shift+Up/Down) affects all colonists globally.  As far as I am aware, this is an unavoidable quirk of the game's logic, and not something I can change.


ASSIGN MENU (Press Shift+A)
----------------------------
Manage colonist assignments across five policy categories: Outfit, Food Restrictions,
Drug Policies, Allowed Areas, and Reading Policies (Ideology DLC only).

Navigation:
Left/Right    Switch between policy categories (columns)
Up/Down       Navigate available policies within current category
Enter         Apply selected policy to current colonist
Tab           Switch to next colonist
E         Open policy editor/manager for current category
Escape        Close assign menu

Policy Editor Controls:
When you press E to open a policy editor, you can manage policies:

Up/Down       Navigate policy list (in policy list mode)
Tab           Enter actions menu
escape     Return to policy list
Enter         Execute selected action or confirm
Escape        Go back/close editor

Available Actions:
- New Policy: Create a new policy
- Rename Policy: Rename the selected policy
- Duplicate Policy: Make a copy of the selected policy
- Delete Policy: Delete the selected policy (if not in use)
- Set as Default: Set as the default policy for new colonists
- Edit Filter: Edit apparel/food filters (navigate with arrows, Space to toggle, Enter to expand/collapse)
- Edit Drugs: Configure drug usage settings (navigate drugs, edit dosage schedules and conditions)
- Close: Return to assign menu

Notes:
- Outfit policies let you control what clothes colonists will wear
- Food policies restrict what foods colonists can eat
- Drug policies control when and how colonists use drugs
- Allowed areas restrict where colonists can go
- Reading policies (Ideology DLC) control what colonists read for ideological development.  These policies are untested, and the custom editor is not yet supported.  I do not have the DCLs yet, so I will be saving all DLC features for later.
